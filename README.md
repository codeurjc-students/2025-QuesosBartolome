# 2025-QUESOS BARTOLOMÉ

## Version 0.1
For this version, we have started with the basic functionalities of our cheese sales and production control website. In this first release, the essential features have been implemented to provide context for what the platform will become in the future, beginning with the simplest yet most general options.

For unregistered users: register, log in, view the cheeses available on the website along with their details, and access the “About Us” section.

For registered users: everything above, plus the ability to view their own profile and place orders.

And for administrators: view both the orders placed and the customers of the cheese factory.

With these basic features, we take the first step toward what will become our final website. Thanks to them, users can begin familiarizing themselves with the platform, and administrators can start getting to know the future production management tools that the site will include.

### Upcoming Features
For the next version (0.2) of the application, the following functionalities are expected to be included:

- Unregistered users: View reviews for each cheese and access the profile of each review’s author.
- Registered users: Edit their profile and credentials, as well as view, create, delete, and edit reviews.
- Administrators: Add, edit, and delete cheeses from the website, ban users, and visualize basic charts.

With this, we take another step toward a more complete and dynamic website, moving closer to the final experience we aim to offer.
