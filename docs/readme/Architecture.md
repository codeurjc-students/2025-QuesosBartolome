### Architecture

#### Deployment
The Quesos Bartolom√© application has a deployment architecture with independent processes that communicate with each other.

- Frontend: Implemented in Angular, it runs as an SPA, contains the user interface, and communicates with the service through the REST API.
- Backend: Developed with Spring Boot, it functions as the application service, providing the REST API consumed by the client.

#### API REST
The REST API is properly documented using OpenAPI.
